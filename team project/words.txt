Thank You Name,
I have going to talk about international students coming to the US, 
As we can see from the GEO visualization that India and China have the most number incoming students
Contary to Popular Belief, most international students come for Master's degree rather than a Doctoral's Degree.

International Students contribute 37Billion to American Economy in 2020, Due to the COVID-19, the amount slightly reduced due to travel restrictions.Engineering is the most popular field of study, that is why we can see from the viz, California has the highest amount of student enrollment and highest earner from fees as it has silicon valley and most engineering job and best engineering colleges are in the silicon valley

Talking about our personal experience as a team, 4 of us are from India, so I would to like to talk about our experience on indian education system. 
 India over 37 million undergraduates as compared to 21 million in the US, that is a lot of students,putting a strain on the indian job sector ,which is why many indian students travel abroad for better education and employment oppurtunities.india ahs population over 1.34 BIllion people.
India ahs 44,000 Inbound and 277,387 Outbound students

 From that number, we can seeking the number of students seeking a international degree is rising every year. With most indian students flcoking to the US,UK,Australia,Canada. nUmber of students going abroad is increasing every years

CHallenges of higher education:
Old Syllabus that is not industry ready
Quota System
Political Factor
Theortical BAsed Learning
